# CodeQuiz

This is a simple Code Quiz for Beginners

The questions are easy and based off of what we have learned in our first few weeks of class

The questions are randomized from the array and displayed on the screen in random order, so there may be some repeats

The questions array can be expanded to include up to hundreds of questions

The game keeps track of your correct answers

The goal is to get as many correct answers as you can within the 75 second time frame

The timer starts when you click the Start Game button

Once the timer is up, the game prompts you to give your initials, though there isn't a limit so users can write whatever they want there at any length

After you submit you initials the game saves your score using local storage and displays the scores from multiple attempts

The buttons work and the try again button goes right into the game by calling upon the startGame function again
